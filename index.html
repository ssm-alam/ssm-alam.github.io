    <h2>Research Interest</h2>
    <p>
      Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a powerful strategy for controlling cancer progression
      by harnessing the host immune system. Immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-1/PD-L1,
      CTLA-4, and VISTA play critical roles in tumor-mediated immune suppression.
      My research interest lies in understanding the structural and functional mechanisms
      governing these immune checkpoints and exploring computational strategies to modulate
      their activity. By targeting immune checkpoint signaling, this work aims to contribute
      to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for effective cancer immunotherapy.

        <strong>Immunoinformatics-based design of a multi-epitope cancer vaccine targeting PD-L1</strong><br>
        <em>Scientific Reports (2025)</em><br>
        This study presents a structure-guided vaccine design integrating epitope prediction,
        molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and immune response modeling
        to rationally target PD-L1 for cancer immunotherapy.
